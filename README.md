# TinyApp
## Authored by: Kelsey Griffin

### A full stack web app built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly)!

Welcome to TinyApp - here you can shorten a URL into a tiny string of letters and numbers. This string can be used to link you to the original long URL through this app.

Want to log out and come back later - no problem! Your short URLs will be saved to your account :D (as long as server is still running).


#### Usage:

Start server with `$ npm start` from the tinyapp directory in your terminal.
Navigate to localhost:8080 in your browser, where you will be greeted with a Welcome page and links to register or login. 

You must be registered and logged in to have fun on TinyApp.
Users can only access, edit, and delete shortened URLs that are attributed to their account.

Enjoy!
